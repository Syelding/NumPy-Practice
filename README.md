# Data Analysis using Python
Data Analysts and Data Scientists use Python for data analysis because the Python programming language is easy to understand, it is scalable and flexible, it has an extensive collection of libraries for numerical computation and data manipulation. On top of that, python provides libraries for data visualizations and their are millions of other python users who have created communities to help solve the many questions and for even collaboration.
This project I will show you the skills I learned on how to use Python for Data Analysis. I will start by learning about the different libraries while including hands on practice utilizing Google Colab. Next, I will display my data cleaning skills and after the data has been cleaned I will show you some data visualizations.


[Part 1]
NumPy is one of the most important libraries to data analysis. It is a numeric computing library that does mathematical operations efficiently. Since computers can only process 1's and 0's and not decimal numbers processing code can take up lots of space. Hence, using NumPy allows you to control size in terms of bits. In NumPy there are  a few objects [ OBJECT- a collection of data and or variables in methods]. You can store data in lists or in arrays. Arrays are a  container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. In my practice I learned how to create arrays, index arrays, slice arrays, and determine the size, shape, and dimension of arrays. This was quite fun and I hope you enjoy reading my code


[Part 2]
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. The reason why pandas is important is that Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Hence, relevant data is very important in data science.
